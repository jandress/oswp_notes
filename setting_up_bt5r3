This class uses Backtrack 5 r3, which is now sad as all its repos are dead. Furthermore, the default vmware tools 
does not function, so no copy and paste and no auto screen resolution. We can rebuild it, we have the technology...

update from the repos:
apt-get update

install open vmware tools:
apt-get install open-vm-tools

reboot!

in theory, you could update other packages from these repos, but you may break bt in the process so its likely a bad idea.

if vmware tools need to be restarted because they've gone sideways (no copy paste for example), the command is:
/etc/vmware-tools/services.sh restart

Using ssh:
sshd-generate
service ssh start
